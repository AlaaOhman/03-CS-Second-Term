# Lecture 1

__*Compiler*__ a program that takes a program written in a
source language and translates it into an equivalent
program in a target language.<br>
**Techniques** used in compiler design can be applicable
to many problems in computer science. <br>

| **Techniques used in**  | **Can be used in** |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| lexical analyzer    | text editors,information retrieval system, and pattern recognition programs     |
| parser       | query processing system such as SQL       |
| compiler design | - Natural Language Processing (NLP) <br> - Software having a complex front-end |

## Parts of a Compiler

| | **Analysis**  | **Synthesis** |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| **In this phase** | An intermediate representation is created from the given source program. | The equivalent target program is created from this intermediate representation. |
| **Parts** | - Lexical Analyzer <br>- Syntax Analyzer <br>- Semantic Analyzer | - Intermediate Code Generator<br>- Code Generator<br>- Code Optimizer |

## Phases of a Compiler

From source program to target program, the compiler goes through the following phases.

| Phase | what happens |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Lexical Analyzer | |
| Syntax Analyzer | |
| Semantic Analyzer | |
| Intermediate Code Generator | |
| Code Optimizer| |
| Code Generator| |

Each phase transforms the source program from one representation into another. <br>
They communicate with:
* error handlers.
* the symbol table.
